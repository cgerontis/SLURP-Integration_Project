Folders:
1)ArbotiX Sketches
2)drivers
3)hardware
4)libraries

The contents of this folder are the ArbotiX Sketches, drivers, hardware, and libraries.
Some of these contents may be redundant but I placed all of the files I have in those 
folders just in case. These folders should be placed in the arduino folder of your computer
if you wish to update the firmware on PATT. You don't have to replace your files with these
but you must ensure that you have at least all of the files from these folders in the corresponding
folders on your computer, along with whatever other files you had.
