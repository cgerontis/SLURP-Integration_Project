This folder contains the only necessarry calibration file for GOMP to run. This file is to be used with
the "Motive" software. All you need to do is open Motive, select "Open exiting project", and select the
one in this folder. This automatically begins data transmission and defines the rigid body, although
re-defining the rigid body once in a while can improve accurracy.
